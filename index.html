			<p class="summary">On April 29, 1992, the Los Angeles riots began with a gathering on Florence and Normandie where the police set a precedence that would recur throughout the coming days: they retreated. Sparked by the acquittal for the four officers involved in the Rodney King beating, and fueled by a growing distrust of the Korean-American community by the African-American community in Los Angeles after an incident a year prior when a Korean storeowner of Empire Liquor was essentially acquitted for the shooting and killing 15-year old Latisha Harlins, Los Angeles became a war zone with its targets set on Korean-American businesses. Over 2,000 of the 3,100 businesses looted or destroyed were owned by Korean-Americans. The police abandoned Angelenos to fend for themselves, which resulted in a surge of gun purchases by the Korean-American community to defend their businesses.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="summary">This graphic takes a look at the hour-by-hour rundown of the chaos and action taken as detailed by the Los Angeles Times&rsquo; 2002 article titled &ldquo;Charting the Hours of Chaos.&rdquo; The events have been aligned to the hour of the day it took place, while the day of the event has been mapped starting from the inner circle moving outwards to show the progression of days. The red circle indicates violence occuring over 24 hours with 12 hours representing one full cycle. Darker red means two 12-hour cycles.</p>

			<span class='tooltiptext'>Mark Garcia, a 15-year-old Latino youth, was shot and killed Thursday, April 30, 1992, in Lennox.<br>
			Friends said he was drawn by curiosity to the looting and fires in a mini-mall at Hawthorne Boulevard and 101st Street but did not participate.<br>
			An initial Sheriff's Department report alleged that Mark was one of four jewelry shop looters who fled in a black Ford Tempo and engaged in a shootout with Deputies Wayne Beckley and Jeffrey Moore.<br>
			The suspected looters bailed out of their car six blocks away. Deputies caught up with them in a nearby parking lot and returned fire, killing Mark.<br>
			The boy turned out to be unarmed. Witnesses, including two youths in the Tempo, have told The Times that Mark had not been in the car with them.<br>
			Sheriff's investigators later confirmed that Mark was already at the parking lot when the looting suspects arrived and was shot while fleeing with them from deputies.

			<span class='tooltiptext'>Matthew Haines, a 32-year-old white man, was beaten and shot in the head, Thursday, April 30, 1992, in Long Beach.<br>
			Haines and his nephew, Scott Coleman, 26, were pulled from Haines'  motorcycle at the corner of Lemon Avenue and Pacific Coast Highway. Haines was beaten, kicked and fatally shot in the head. Coleman was shot but survived.<br>
			In February 1993, a Superior Court jury acquitted Larry Williams, 24, Fabian Nixon, 19, and Brent Lamar Jones, 18,  of murder. Instead they were found guilty of assault with a deadly weapon and conspiring to assault, loot and rob. The jury said the three weren't guilty of murder because "there wasn't evidence proving that the three defendants actually did shoot the victim," the forewoman said at the time.<br> 
			Williams and Nixon were sentenced to nearly six years in prison and ordered to pay restitution.  Jones, who was a minor at the time, was  sentenced to five years and eight months in the California Youth Authority and ordered to pay $5,000 to a crime victims' restitution fund.<br>

			<span class='tooltiptext'>DeAndre Harrison, a 17-year-old-black man, was fatally shot Thursday, April 30, 1992, near the intersection of Central Avenue and 112th Street in Green Meadows.  He was taken to Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center, where he died.<br>
			Less than four hours after truck driver Reginald O. Denny and others were attacked at Florence and Normandie, four LAPD officers in a patrol car said they came under intense fire from looters outside a Korean American-owned store in Green Meadows at Central Avenue and 112th Street.<br>
			The officers returned fire and then sped off to await reinforcements. One of seven rounds they fired had hit a heavyset, shirtless gunman.<br>
			When they returned, the victim and his weapon had vanished. LAPD officials later learned that 17-year-old Harrison had died of a gunshot wound at the hospital, and ballistics tests showed that he had been struck by a 9-millimeter bullet fired by an LAPD officer.<br>
			Harrison was angry over the verdicts in the King beating case, relatives said, and had helped loot clothing stores earlier in the night.<br>
			But whether he was the shirtless suspect who shot at police is another question.<br>
			About 10:30 p.m., there was a soft knock on the door of an apartment Harrison's girlfriend shared with her mother, Myra Collins. It was Harrison, Collins said later, and he was wearing a blood-drenched T-shirt with a small bullet hole in the chest.<br>
			"It was just like when you watch these westerns and they stagger in the door," she said.<br>
			"I don't know what DeAndre was doing," Collins said. "I don't know if he was an angel or a devil. But he did have on a white T-shirt."<br>
			"He was just a kid that got caught up in a vicious cycle," said Verbum Dei High School Principal Robert Mendoza, who had known Harrison for years. "It's very difficult to live around here."</span>

			Charles "Sticks" Orebo and two friends, Andre Webb and Lavelle "Frog" Williams were driving toward a South Los Angeles house where Webb planned to spend the night.<br>
			Near Florence Avenue and the 110 Freeway, Orebo tried to make a lane change, nearly cutting off a car behind him. The other driver honked and pulled alongside at a stoplight.<br>
			Williams drew a handgun, loaded it and pointed it past Orebo toward the other driver, an LAPD officer who was out of uniform and en route to work.<br>
			"The guy looked at us," Webb said, "and he jumped like he was in shock. Then he pulled up his gun. . . . Then he shot like three times and hit Sticks."<br>
			Orebo, mortally wounded, punched the accelerator. The car lurched into a wall and caught fire.<br>
			Orebo, a dropout and the father of a 4-year-old son, had planned to get married the next month and become an auto mechanic, said his mother, Georgia Alfred.<br>
			He had been jailed a couple of times for traffic tickets and other small offenses, she said. "But nothing violent. No guns or anything like that."<br>
			Alfred said her son and Williams watched the verdicts in the King beating case together and were angry, "but he wasn't going out beating anyone or carrying a gun."<br>
			"From what I gathered, my son didn't know [Williams] had the gun until he pulled it up," she said. "I'm angry, but I'm angry with the young man."

			Ratinoff would never have ended up at the Bob's Market on Gateway Boulevard in West Los Angeles if the store where he normally shopped had remained open during the riots. The produce manager apparently got angry when Ratinoff dropped some corn husks on the floor while shopping for vegetables, and the pair tussled.<br>

			Martin's luck finally ran out three days after the verdicts in the King beating case. The father of three, who grew up only a couple of blocks from King, was killed by a stray bullet.<br>
			The incident began, police said, when two officers tried to disperse more than 150 party-goers at a Pasadena apartment complex but were greeted with rocks and bottles -- and gunshots.<br>
			Nearly 25 more officers arrived quickly, and 10 of them fired a total of 70 rounds at several assailants.<br>
			Martin, relatives said, was visiting friends at a nearby apartment when he stepped onto a balcony to look at what was going on. He was struck in the head by a police bullet that apparently ricocheted off the street, police said.<br>
